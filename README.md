# Banish-IPFire
This addon alows the administrator to generate a personel blocklst through menus on the IPFire GUI and genearate iptables rules to block by IP Address,CIDR, MAC Address or fully qualified domain name 
This is a port of Banish IPCop addon to IPFire. The Banish addon was written by Sid McLaurin but seems to have abandoned arround 2008 and I can no longer find any trace of the original author.
